	<h2>Deliciousness in every bite!</h2> 
	<p><i>Every</i> fish sold at the MedomCharles store is from original source and is made fresh... adequately dihyrated, dried and or smoked for best flavor and taste.
Unbleached flour with the best flavor and textures.  Organic sugar only from India.  Eggs from chickens that listen to classical music.  Even our water is special.  It comes from Cascade Mountain springs that we hike up to retrieve.</p>
	<p>Baking is our passion and we take it very seriously.</p>
